when the key fob's battery is empty
The LF field generated by the vehicle's base station supplies the
key fob with power via antenna coupling via short-range LF-to-LF communication.

Key Fob Wake-Up
reduces battery lifetime
The Atmel MCU remains in sleep mode until a wake-up occurs
The highly sensitive 3-axis LF amplifier has a very low-power listening mode that constantly checks for a valid LF signal

Once it has received a valid LF signal containing the correct vehicle-specific wake-up ID, it
generates a signal to wake up the PEPS controller.

Key Fob Localization
A car has typically four to six LF antennas
These produce an LF magnetic field covering both the car interior and the car's vicinity
The key fob measures the LF signal level during the communication with the vehicle
It acquires the RSSI and sends it back to the vehicle
, which analyzes the RSSI to determine the fob's position

Vehicle-Cabin LF Coverage
To obtain constant field strength that does not exceed the cabin borders, 
you can adjust the LF power of each antenna individually.
